Title: Introduction to Distributed Vector Databases

Vector databases are designed to store, index, and search high-dimensional vector embeddings efficiently. These embeddings are typically generated by machine learning models and represent the semantic meaning of unstructured data such as text, images, or audio.

In modern AI systems, vector databases play a critical role in tasks like semantic search, recommendation systems, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Instead of relying on exact keyword matching, vector databases enable similarity search by comparing the distance between vectors using metrics such as cosine similarity, inner product, or Euclidean distance.

Milvus is an open-source vector database built for scalability and performance. It supports multiple indexing algorithms including HNSW, IVF_FLAT, and IVF_PQ, allowing developers to balance search accuracy, latency, and memory usage. Milvus can scale horizontally and is often deployed in cloud-native environments using Kubernetes.

A typical RAG pipeline involves splitting documents into smaller chunks, converting each chunk into an embedding, storing the embeddings in a vector database, and retrieving the most relevant chunks at query time. These retrieved chunks are then provided as context to a large language model to generate accurate and grounded responses.

As the size of vector data grows to millions or even billions of records, efficient indexing and distributed query execution become essential. Choosing the right index type and tuning search parameters can significantly impact both recall quality and system performance.
